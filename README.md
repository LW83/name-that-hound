Bugs: 
1) Bringing in images: Challenges; files paths, bringing into DOM (typos in template literals)
2) Generating random answers and pushing into an array
3) Lining up answers with radio buttons - put in a break after each line changed line from [i] to answerOptions[i] (brought in name of dog as opposed to a number) - was pushing radio options in with string of all options. pushed to new array and (final options) and pulled that into the DOM
